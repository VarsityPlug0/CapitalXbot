## Key Features

1. **Guaranteed Returns**: Each tier offers a 100% return on investment
2. **Consistent Duration**: All investments have a 7-day duration
3. **Progressive Growth**: Investment amounts double with each tier
4. **Compounding Effect**: Reinvesting returns leads to exponential growth
5. **Level-Based Access**: Higher tiers require higher user levels for risk management

## Potential Earnings

If a user starts with R70 and reinvests all returns through all 9 tiers:

- **Total Investment**: R35,830 (sum of all tier investments)
- **Final Return**: R35,840
- **Net Profit**: R70 (from the initial R70 investment)

However, users can also choose to withdraw profits at any tier and only reinvest a portion of their returns.

## Example Scenarios
