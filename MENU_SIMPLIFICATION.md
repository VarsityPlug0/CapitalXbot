This document summarizes the simplification of the CapitalX Telegram bot menu to make it easier for clients to use by removing complex API-dependent options and focusing on core functionality.

## Changes Made

### Simplified Main Menu
The main menu has been reduced from 13 options to just 5 essential options:

1. **💰 Investment Options** - View available investment plans
2. **📊 My Investments** - Check current investments and performance
3. **👥 Referrals** - Access referral program and earnings
4. **📤 Withdraw** - Manage withdrawals and history
5. **❓ Help & Support** - Get assistance and support information

### Removed Complex Options
The following options were removed to reduce complexity:
- 👋 Welcome & Basics
- 💰 Start with Bonus (R50 Free)
- 💳 Start with Your Money

These options are still accessible through other means:
