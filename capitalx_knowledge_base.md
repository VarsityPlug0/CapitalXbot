## Reinvestment Policy

ðŸ”„ **Can You Invest Again? YES, But Once Per Tier!**

You can invest multiple times, but there's an important rule: **one investment per tier plan**.

âœ… **How It Works:**
â€¢ You can invest in EACH tier plan once
â€¢ You can have multiple tier investments running simultaneously
â€¢ Each investment is independent and lasts 12 hours to 6 days

ðŸ“ˆ **Example:**
1. Invest in Starter Plan (R70) - 12 hours
2. At the same time, invest in Bronze Plan (R140) - 18 hours
3. When Starter Plan completes, reinvest in Silver Plan (R280) - 24 hours
4. Continue investing in different tiers with their respective durations

ðŸ’¡ **Key Points:**
â€¢ One investment per tier plan allowed
â€¢ You can invest in multiple different tiers at the same time
â€¢ Each tier investment runs independently for its specific duration (12 hours to 6 days)
â€¢ Reinvest profits in higher tier plans when ready

ðŸ’° **Bonus Path Investors:**
â€¢ Use your R50 bonus to start with a tier plan
â€¢ Reinvest profits from completed investments
â€¢ Continue compounding your growth with different tiers

ðŸ’³ **Direct Path Investors:**
