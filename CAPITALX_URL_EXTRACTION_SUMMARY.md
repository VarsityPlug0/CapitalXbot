# CapitalX URL Extraction Summary

## Task
Extract all non-admin page URLs from the CapitalX website (https://capitalx-rtn.onrender.com/) to provide to clients.

## Approach
1. First attempted to scrape the website directly to discover all URLs
2. Encountered timeout issues indicating the website may be blocking requests or is temporarily unavailable
3. Created an alternative approach to extract known URLs from the existing codebase and knowledge base

## Results
Successfully extracted 2 non-admin URLs that can be shared with clients:

1. **Main Website**: https://capitalx-rtn.onrender.com/
2. **Registration Page**: https://capitalx-rtn.onrender.com/register/

## Files Generated
- [CAPITALX_CLIENT_URLS.txt](file:///C:/Users/money/HustleProjects/BevanTheDev/Telegrambot/CAPITALX_CLIENT_URLS.txt) - Plain text list of URLs
- [CAPITALX_CLIENT_URLS.md](file:///C:/Users/money/HustleProjects/BevanTheDev/Telegrambot/CAPITALX_CLIENT_URLS.md) - Formatted markdown list of URLs

## Notes
- The website appears to be inaccessible or blocking automated requests, preventing comprehensive URL discovery
- The extracted URLs are confirmed to exist based on analysis of the codebase and knowledge base files
- These URLs are non-admin pages and safe to share with clients
- Additional URLs may exist on the website but could not be discovered due to accessibility issues

## Recommendation
If more comprehensive URL discovery is needed, consider:
1. Checking if the website is temporarily down
2. Contacting the website administrators for a sitemap
3. Manually browsing the website to identify additional pages
