# Conflict Resolution Success

## Issue Summary
The CapitalX Telegram bot was experiencing persistent "Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request" errors during deployment to Render. This occurred because Telegram only allows one active instance of a bot at a time, and during deployment, a new instance would conflict with the existing one.

## Solution Implemented
We enhanced the conflict handling in [main.py](file:///c:/Users/money/HustleProjects/BevanTheDev/Telegrambot/main.py) with several improvements:

1. **Increased retry limits**: From 5 to 10 retries to give more chances for successful startup
2. **Added `drop_pending_updates=True`**: Clears pending updates when starting the bot
3. **Improved timeout settings**: Increased all timeout values to 45 seconds
4. **Enhanced Render-specific handling**: Added a 10-second delay before exiting on Render
5. **Better exponential backoff**: Maximum limit of 60 seconds for retry delays

## Result
The bot now successfully handles deployment conflicts:
- Detects conflicts and exits gracefully on Render
- Allows the health check system to restart the bot
- Eventually starts successfully when conflicts are resolved
- Processes updates normally with "200 OK" responses

## Verification
From the deployment logs, we can see:
1. Initial conflict errors: "409 Conflict" 
2. Successful resolution: "HTTP Request: POST .../getUpdates "HTTP/1.1 200 OK""
3. Bot is now live and processing updates normally
